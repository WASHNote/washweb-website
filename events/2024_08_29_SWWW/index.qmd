There is a hidden potential is WASH data that is unlocked when data is
used and shared effectively. This event looks at the potential of open
WASH data and how it can be used more appropriately. In particular, the
event brings together partners across the public and private sector,
local and international NGOs, and multilaterals to discuss how our
community and partnership can have a greater impact through open WASH
data.There is a hidden potential is WASH data that is unlocked when data
