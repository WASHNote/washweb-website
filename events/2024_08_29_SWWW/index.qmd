## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Welcome!

There is a hidden potential is WASH data that is unlocked when data is
used and shared effectively.

This event looks at the potential of open WASH data and how it can be
used more appropriately. In particular, the event brings together
partners across the public and private sector, local and international
NGOs, and multilaterals to discuss how our community and partnership can
have a greater impact through open WASH data.There is a hidden potential
