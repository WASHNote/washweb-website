## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Welcome!

How are partnerships driving efforts towards a more effective WASH data
ecosystem?

Listen and engage with a variety of WASH and data leaders from different
context and cases who have set up partnerships to improve WASH data
sharing. This webinar will share experiences from partnerships in
countries to partnerships in international cooperation and communities
of practice.

What can we learn from these leaders? How can we replicate these
practices?

Additionally, speakers will offer insights related to open data and data
sharing within specific communities from different countries around the
world.
